## Dojo Tracker

![site](https://i.imgur.com/aEwFBGO.png)

Disclaimer: this is a work currently in early progress.

### Goals of the site:

Provide CodeCoolers with an App where they can:

- track their completed "Dojos" (Algorythmic exercizes).
- save solutions for completed dojos.
- see how they rank compared to other codecoolers.
- see variuous statistics about their progress.
- ask mentors & peers for their feedback on solutions.


### Motivations for building this project:

Further my knowledge in:

- front-end design patterns.
- testing front-end applications.
- designing user friendly & clear UI without using frameworks (eg. bootstrap/materialUI/antDesign).
- deepen knowladge building React apps.

Practice working in a team imitating a real work project, where we have:

- Front end dev(s).
- Back end dev(s).
- A test automation engineer.
- A product owner with their own needs.


### In order to run the website:

-  Please download the backend API from (and follow readme.md): https://github.com/GyulaHodosi/dojoTrackerBE
- Install dependencies :  `npm install` from project root.
- Run the development server with: `npm start`
- To run unit tests use command: `npm test.


### Technologies used:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Styled components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- [React testing library](https://testing-library.com/)


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
